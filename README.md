Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation Based on Deep Learning  
In terms of safety engineering, for hazardous gas leakage, forest fire spread, etc., computational fluid dynamics simulation is generally used. However, the CFD method has low timeliness
Using deep learning methods for model generation. This project has designed a VAE+DCGAN+Transformer model, which only requires input of wind speed, direction, and leakage
Three data indicators are used to predict the results.

**Due to academic involvement, the project is currently not publicly available**   
**Planned after June 2024**
